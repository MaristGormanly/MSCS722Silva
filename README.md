Project 1: Native Game

The game I have created is called Space Dash! 

The objective of the game is to dash through space and collect the stars while avoiding the asteroid belt! If the 
rocketship hits the asteroid belt or falls out of orbit (falling to the ground) the player loses! Each star is worth
one point. In order to play the game the player must continuously tap to go through the asteroid belt and collect the
stars! It's a side scroller game, with infinate scroll so the game is score based rather than level based.

I created all the images myself using Adobe Illustrator and even found a copyright free sound that I've used in the past when creating other
games. Unfortunately, the computers in HC don't have speakers so I was unable to record the sound in my video. My game design background 
really came in handy with this project and I really enjoyed creating this game. I struggled creating a top 10 highscore but I did manage to have it save the score when you "x" out of the simulator and reboot the iphone.

Please find the link to the video on the bottom of this read me.

Project 2: Beat Motion

Due to the Covid-19 I had to change my OS system to android. I struggle a bit with the transition and unfortunately was not able to complete all the functions. My main issue was being unable to fully test the media recording fucntion, since it currently does not work on the android studio emulator. I have an iphone so I was unable to locally test the app. 

This is the android studio develop website stating the mediarecorder function doesn't currently work on the emulator. I unfortunately found that out a little late in the game, as it was driving me insane because I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. The app crashes due to mediarecorder not being supported on the emulator once you click stop recording.
