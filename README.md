Enterprise Mobile Development 
Project 1: Native Game

The game I have created is called Space Dash! 

The objective of the game is to dash through space and collect the stars while avoiding the asteroid belt! If the 
rocketship hits the asteroid belt or falls out of orbit (falling to the ground) the player loses! Each star is worth
one point. In order to play the game the player must continuously tap to go through the asteroid belt and collect the
stars! It's a side scroller game, with infinate scroll so the game is score based rather than level based.

I created all the images myself using Adobe Illustrator and even found a copyright free sound that I've used in the past when creating other
games. Unfortunately, the computers in HC don't have speakers so I was unable to record the sound in my video. My game design background 
really came in handy with this project and I really enjoyed creating this game. Please find the link to the video on the bottom of this read me.
